# OBS Startup Apps
This script makes it easier to manage any programs you always need running alongside obs.
# Features
- open any file, directory, or url when obs starts up
# Usage
## Windows
Before obs can use python scripts, it needs to know where to find a compatibe python interpreter. You can either:
- Use my [OBS Python Installer](https://github.com/sugoidogo/obs-python-installer) to detect or install a compatible python interpreter and update your obs settings automatically
- Locate your existing python install via `Tools > Scripts > Python Settings`
## All Platforms
Download and extract the (latest release)[https://github.com/sugoidogo/obs-startup-apps/releases/latest] into any directory, and then add the script to OBS via `Tools > Scripts > +` (bottom-left of the scripts window). From there you can add or remove any startup apps.
